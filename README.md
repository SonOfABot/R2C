# R2C
R2C was a little reverse shell written in Nim  in early 2023, I was learning Nim then and I had this engagement where I was unable to drop any shells to the target to get reverse shell or anything, just a very limited shell with upload functionalities, so there was this craze about nim beating typical windows AV then and all, remember a youtube where the guy did a revshell in nim, went to watch, learnt more then built mine, his was in windows and windows was my target, later on I just built it to have linux support too and you can get system information with just `sysinfo`

You can chose to hardcode the IP and port or run it as a command, then I couldn't, it was a web, upload the file then call it.
